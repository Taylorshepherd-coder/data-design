	"Makeup is a women's best friend" -Marie May
<p/>
<p>
	Marie May is a 24 year old woman from Albuquerque, New Mexico who loves to watch videos on makeup tutorials weekly to keep up with new style trends. She watches videos to learn new styles via Youtube and she watches them on her Andriod phone and her laptop. Marie May has a Galaxys10 for a phone, and uses a Dell Laptop that she got for her 21st birthday for a computer. She isn't new to makeup but she hasn't gone to beauty school either to get a degree, she is all self-taught. Marie keeps up with the newest makeup styles and trends and tries to recreate those styles on herself and her friends. She would be considered what her friends call her a "professional makeup artist" simply because of all the videos she watches and the time she spends watching them, and the time she spends actually practicing these styles on herself and her friends. She likes to follow certain Youtubers who mainly recreate the newest trends in makeup especially those who also use her favorite brands of makeup such as Chanell, Mac and Bare Minerals. Marie May has blue eyes and often likes to watch makeup tutorials that help enhance blue eyes more using certain eyeshadow colors. She also likes to keep up with the other eye color styles as well so she can do the best makeup possible, depending on the customers eye color. Marie May freelances on the side, so this is not only her passion but she is able to make some money on the side out of it as well. She has been looking into going to school for cosutume design makeup to do makeup for those that are in movies.
